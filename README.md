## Hi, this is Boris

I'm brutally and relentlessly focused, driven to write perfect, optimized, beautiful code. I don't do "Quick Fixes" nor "Small hacks". There is always a solution - the adventure and pleasure comes from finding it. 

High standards define my work, the need for innovation and development defines me. 

I adhere to industry standards set by the various interop groups, and if none exist, I'll set my own standard, future proofed, abstract and succinct. The Gang of Four occupies my bookshelves to the point I can just answer with the page numbers where certain structures and patterns are defined.

Constantly evolving, with a passion for learning and teaching alike. I'd like to boast that I might have been a mentor for at least one team-member, but doing that I feel like Michael Scott with his "World's Best Boss" mug. So let's stick to "I've reviewed pull-requests and given meaningful feedback resulting in code-changes" instead.

I dislike personality tests and other types of tests that try to measure me, feels like simplistic mementos in an ever changing world we adapt to and learn from. But my last free test did say I am ENTP-T, so that might be related.
